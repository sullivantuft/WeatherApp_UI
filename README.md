# Overview

This application is a demonstation of the skills I have aquired in the Kotlin language as well as working with Jetpack Compose

This software is a basic weather application that allows you to input a city and receive the current weather in temperature, precipitation and windspeed.

This mobile application was writted for me to learn about Mobile App Development as well as to understand UI in Kotlin.
